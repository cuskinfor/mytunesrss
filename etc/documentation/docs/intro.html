        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to MyTunesRSS release candidate 1. It has been a while since the last
            official relase of MyTunesRSS which was v2.3.6 back in December 2006. We have
            been working on version 3.0 and there have been 21 beta releases during the
            last months through our forums. Thanks to all the people who helped us finding
            bugs and all the useful comments and suggestions. Since version 3.0 is now
            feature complete we decided to make the first official release which you just
            downloaded. We hope you will enjoy the new version as much or even more than
            the previous one.
        </p>

        <p>
            The documentation will be completely rewritten from scratch and it will be
            available online either on our website or probably in a special section in
            our forums. The forums should be a place for all discussion regarding
            MyTunesRSS. Please visit our website for a link to the forums. You can read
            and browse without creating a user account.
