        <h1>Browse library</h1>

        <p>
            The most powerful feature of MyTunesRSS is browsing the library. Starting on the portal page you can reach the page for browsing by
            artist. These are listed in alphabetic order and depending on the set number of items per page there are multiple pages. Above the list is
            a page with groups of letters. The group "A - C" for example contains all artists beginning with the letters A, B and C.</p>

        <p>
            To the right of each artist the number of albums this artist has tracks on and the number of tracks of this artist is displayed. You can
            click the number of albums to show them. Clicking the number of tracks displays a list of those tracks.</p>

        <p>At the end of each line are icons for creating M3U playlists or RSS feeds from all tracks of an artist. You can also download a ZIP archive
           with all titles of the artist with the download icon.</p>

        <p>Above the list are links for switching to browse albums and for creating ne playlists. This function will be described in a later
           chapter.</p>

        <img src="images/web_artist.png" width="463" alt="artist list" />

        <p>The list of albums looks similar. It shows all albums sorted alphabetically. Next to each album is the artist or "various" if there are
           multiple artists on the album, the track count for the album and the icons for creating M3U playlists or RSS feeds. The link for
           downloading all titles of the album in a ZIP archive is available as well. With a click on the track count you get to the track list
           display. A click on the artist (not supported for "various") takes you to all albums of this artist. In case you have a filtered list, i.e.
           all albums of a single artist, you also get a special item at the bottom which is called "All tracks of the above albums". This is
           displayed only if there are multiple albums for an artist.</p>

        <img src="images/web_album.png" width="463" alt="album list" />

        <p>
            The track list is displayed when searching on the portal page or with a click on the track count in any other list. The titles are sorted
            and grouped either by album or by artist. You can switch from one view to the other. You can also create RSS feeds or M3U playlists from
            each track or a group of tracks. In the group headers as well as in each title, the artist name is clickable and leads to all albums of
            that artist. You can also simply download individual tracks, e.g. for getting it to the Playstation Portable without having to use an USB
            link. Video files are marked with the video icon and protected files (bought in the iTunes Music Store) are marked with a lock icon.</p>

        <img src="images/web_track.png" width="463" alt="track list" />

        <p>The following icons are used throughout the application:</p>

        <p><img src="../images/movie.gif" alt="video" style="vertical-align:text-bottom" /> video file</p>

        <p><img src="../images/protected.gif" alt="protected" style="vertical-align:text-bottom" /> protected file (only playable in iTunes)</p>

        <p><img src="../images/rss.gif" alt="rss" style="vertical-align:text-bottom" /> create RSS feed</p>

        <p><img src="../images/m3u.gif" alt="m3u" style="vertical-align:text-bottom" /> create M3U playlist</p>

        <p><img src="../images/download.gif" alt="download" style="vertical-align:text-bottom" /> download track</p>
