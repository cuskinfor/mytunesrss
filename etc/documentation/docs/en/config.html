        <h1>The configuration</h1>

        <p>
            After starting the application you see the configuration panel. The settings are placed on three tabs. The first tab contains the general
            settings. </p>
        <img src="images/general.png" alt="Allgemeine Einstellungen" />

        <p>
            You can choose the port the server is listening for incoming connection freely. The default port 8080 should be okay in almost call cases.
            On some systems use of ports below 1024 might be restricted. </p>

        <p>
            For security reasons you have to choose a password for protecting access to the web application. The server will not start without a
            password. The password is stored as plain text, so please do not use a password you are using to protect critical data elsewhere.</p>

        <p>
            In the lower part of the general settings tab you have to specify the path to the "iTunes Music Library.xml" file on your system. You can
            either enter the path directly into the text field or use the (...) button to browse your harddisk and look it up. On Windows systems this
            file usually is found in the "iTunes" folder in "My Music". On Mac OS X you should find it in the "iTunes" folder in "Music".</p>
        <img src="images/options.png" alt="Optionen" />

        <p>
            The second tab shows additional options. Topmost you can see the status of the database integrated in MyTunesRSS. This database contains
            all the data from the "iTunes Music Library.xml" file. It is created or updated automatically each time you start the server.</p>

        <p>
            In "automation" you can select to start the server automatically when starting MyTunesRSS. This way you can put the application into your
            system's startup items and have the server up and running when booting your operating system. Furthermore you can have MyTunesRSS
            automatically check for new versions on startup. This option is not available in case you choose to start the server automatically. You
            can also look for new versions manually. When the server is running you can have it automatically check for changes in iTunes and have the
            internal database updated. Select the number of seconds between these checks.</p>

        <img src="images/info.png" alt="Informationen" />

        <p>
            On the third page you can find information about the development team. Please donate if you find the programm useful. In case you have
            problems and need support, you can click the button on this page to obtain a zipped log file. Please attach the log file to support
            request mails.</p>

        <p>
            Below the configuration pages are three buttons for starting and stopping the server and for quitting the program. You cannot change any
            settings while the server is running. When the server is started, the status line on the first configuration tab displays your local
            address which can be used to access the MyTunesRSS web application. Usually you have a single address which is displayed. In case you have
            multiple network interfaces, e.g. LAN and WLAN, you have multiple addresses as well. Move the mouse over the status line and wait for the
            tooltip to open. It displays all local addresses.</p>

        <p>
            When quitting the program while the server is running, it is stopped. The window position and all settings are automatically saved for the
            next start.</p>
