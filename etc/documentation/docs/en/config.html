        <h1>The configuration</h1>

        <p>
            After starting the application you see a configuration panel. The settings can be found on three pages. On the first page you can make
            general settings. </p>
        <img src="images/general.png" alt="General settings" />

        <p>
            You can choose the port on which the server is listening for incoming connections. The default port 8080 of the embedded Tomcat server
            should be alright in most cases. On some systems using ports below 1024 might be restricted. </p>

        <p>
            Logging can usually be deactivated. In case you have problems and want to request support from Codewave Software, please always attach a
            log to your request. Activate logging after starting MyTunesRSS and use the application until you encounter the problem. The button "Show
            log" opens a new window with the log messages which can be copied. </p>

        <p>
            When starting the server you might get a message about memory problems. In this case you can increase the maximum memory the application
            may use. Enter the new value in the field and save it using the button next to the field. After saving the new value, you have to restart
            MyTunesRSS to activate it. This option is not available if you do not use the special Windows or Mac OS X starter applications but call
            Java directly from the command line. </p>

        <p>
            In the lower part of the genral settings you have to specify the path to the file "iTunes Music Library.xml" on your system. Either enter
            the path directly or use the (...) button to search and select it. On windows it should be located in the "iTunes" folder which is located
            in "My Music". On Mac OS X it is usually located in "iTunes" which is in "Music". </p>
        <img src="images/options.png" alt="Options" />

        <p>
            The second page shows advanced options. You can activate authentication for the web application here and enter a password. The password is
            saved as plain text, so please do not use a password you are using for protecting critical data elsewhere. </p>

        <p>
            Specifying a fake suffix can be necessary in case the target device which should use the RSS feed does not support the default suffix. The
            Playstation Portable with firmware version 2.60 for example can play AAC files only with the suffix MP4 and not with the standard suffix
            M4A used in iTunes. So you can offer the target device an alternative suffix for the supported file types MP3 and M4A. </p>

        <p>
            In case the target device supports a limited number of entries in an RSS feed only, you can set this limit in MyTunesRSS. The Playstation
            Portable for example does not show more then 100 entries in a feed. When an iTunes playlist is bigger than the configured limit for a
            feed, the list is automatically splitted into multiple lists matching the maximum size. The limit also applies when manually selecting
            titles for a feed. </p>

        <img src="images/info.png" alt="Information" />

        <p>
            On the last page you can find some information on the developer team and a request to make a donation in case you like the program. </p>

        <p>
            Below the configuration pages you find the buttons to start and stop the server and to quit the program. Settings cannot be changed while
            the server is running. After starting the server, the status bar displays the address your server can be reached on your local network.
            Usually you have a single local address (e.g. 192.168.0.2). If you have multiple network interfaces (e.g. a LAN and a WLAN) you have
            multiple local addresses as well. Only one of them is displayed. To see all addresses, please move the pointer over the status text and
            look at the tooltip. </p>

        <p>
            A running server is automatically stopped when quitting the application. The window position is saved automatically for the next start. If
            you made any changes to the configuration, the application asks you whether you want to save them for the next start or discard them. </p>
