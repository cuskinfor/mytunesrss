        MyTunesRSS lets you create RSS feeds from the music in your iTunes music library. Playback of the tracks in the feed is possible with each
        device that has a browser and supports RSS feeds. One such device for example is the Sony Playstation Portable with an appropriate firmware
        version. </p>

    <p>
        MyTunesRSS is an application to configure and start a server. Once the server is running, you can access a web application with any browser.
        With the browser you can search your iTunes music library and create the RSS feed from the results. </p>

    <p>
        You can search your library by artist und album and create an RSS feed from the results. The application supports MP3 files and
        unprotected AAC files. You can create feeds directly from your playlists and restrict access to your
        library through the web application with a password. </p>
