<h1>MyTunesRSS v3.6</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to MyTunesRSS 3.6. We hope you will enjoy the new version as much or even more than the previous one.
    MyTunesRSS 3.6 is a commercial product with no free version. You may evaluate MyTunesRSS for 30 days without
    a license. Please visit the Codewave website for buying a license. If you want to use a freeware version of
    MyTunesRSS you can also download the last version with the freeware mode from the Codewave website.
</p>

<p>
    The directory "jsonrpc_sample" contains a very simple sample application based on plain HTML and JavaScript
    to demmonstrate the MyTunesRSS Remote API using JSON-RPC. You can either install this application into
    the MyTunesRSS Tomcat server using a different context path or into an Apache server and use mod_proxy or AJP to
    access the MyTunesRSS Tomcat through the Apache. This is neccessary because JavaScript does not allow
    cross site scripting and so both applications must run on the same host and port.
</p>

<p>
    The complete documentation for 3.6 is available at the <a href="http://docs.codewave.de/mytunesrss3">Codewave website</a>.
